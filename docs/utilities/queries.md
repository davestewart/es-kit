# Queries

> Reusable query functions to help you build [ES Query DSL](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html) configuration without having to Google the exact format

## Usage

### Importing

You can import the query urtilties in several ways:

```js
// import as a single object (which will code-complete)
import { Queries } from `@davestewart/es-kit`

// import and rename as something easier to type
import { Queries as _ } from `@davestewart/es-kit`

// import individually
import { _match, _multiMatch } from `@davestewart/es-kit`
```

Each of the helpers is typed, so expect proper auto-completion and warnings as you use them.
