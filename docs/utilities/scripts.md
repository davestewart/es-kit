# Scripts

> Powerful helper functions to help you perform scripted updates using precompiled or on-the-fly script conversions

## Usage

### Importing

You can import the scripts in several ways:

```js
// import as a single object (which will code-complete)
import { Scripts } from `@davestewart/es-kit`

// import individually
import { _addToArray, _removeFromArray } from `@davestewart/es-kit/scripts`
```

Each of the helpers is typed, so expect proper auto-completion and warnings as you use them.
