# API

## Introduction

ES Kit provides simple and robust wrappers around Elastic's Document and Search APIs:

Search APIs:

- [Search](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.15/search-search.html)

Document APIs:
 
- [Get](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.15/docs-get.html)
- [Index](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.15/docs-index_.html)
- [Update](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.15/docs-update.html)
- [Delete](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.15/docs-delete.html)

Multiple APIs:

- [Multi search](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.15/search-multi-search.html)
- [Multi Get](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.15/docs-multi-get.html)
- [Update By Query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-update-by-query.html)
- [Delete by Query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.15/docs-delete-by-query.html)
- [Bulk](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.15/docs-bulk.html)

This should allow you to get going quickly and make sensible API calls without drowning in verbose request configuration and response payloads.
